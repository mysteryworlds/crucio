## Description
Crucio was originated as a replacement for plugins like essentials. Although
they have a bunch of features and may work like a charm in many cases they still
lack of various software quality characteristics and can be a pain in the ass
to manage and maintain. Crucio aims to be simple and lightweight replacement
without dropping features.

All commands have a fully working tab completion and are well documented.
